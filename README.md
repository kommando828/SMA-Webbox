# SMA-Webbox

Depositry of Firmware and Device Profile files for the SMA Webbox.

Note that none of these files are for the Bluetooth version of the Webbox.

I have collected these files to enable my Webbox to work with the Sunny Island SI5048 Modbus, thanks to the original posters 

To be able to update the Device Profile you first need to upgrade the firmware to 1.53F12

If you are on a much older Firmware you may have to use the lower numbered firmwares before getting to 1.53F12

On the Device Profiles once you are on Firmware 1.53F12 you can use the upload function introduced on this firmware to load the files.

Device Profile 1.39 gave me the modbus fuctionality I needed.

I have included Device Profile 1.49 and 1.52 but they will not load into my Webbox so use at your own risk.

The profile 1.49 PDF details the changelog up to and including 1.49 so if your inverter is listed added at 1.39 or before 

then you only need Device Profile 1.39
